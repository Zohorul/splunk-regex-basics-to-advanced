# to understand the basic differences between rex and regex



rex - Description
Use this command to either extract fields using regular expression named groups, or replace or substitute characters in a field using sed expressions.

The rex command matches the value of the specified field against the unanchored regular expression and extracts the named groups into fields of the corresponding names. If a field is not specified, the regular expression is applied to the _raw field. Note: Running rex against the _raw field might have a performance impact.

When mode=sed, the given sed expression used to replace or substitute characters is applied to the value of the chosen field. If a field is not specified, the sed expression is applied to _raw. This sed-syntax is also used to mask sensitive data at index-time. Read about using sed to anonymize data in the Getting Data In Manual.

Use the rex command for search-time field extraction or string replacement and character substitution.


regex - Description
The regex command removes results that do not match the specified regular expression.
